"""Performance profiling utilities for MonoBeast distributed training.

This module provides a simple but efficient profiling system that tracks execution
times of different code sections during training. It uses online algorithms to
compute running means and variances of timing measurements, allowing for memory-efficient
tracking of performance statistics.

The implementation is based on Sutton-Barto's incremental mean/variance computation
algorithm, which allows O(1) updates for both mean and variance statistics without
storing the full history of measurements.

Key Features:
- Memory-efficient online statistics computation
- Tracks mean, variance, and standard deviation of execution times
- Provides percentage breakdowns of time spent in different sections
- Thread-unsafe but lightweight for single-threaded profiling

    """Tracks execution time statistics for different code sections.

    This class maintains running statistics (mean, variance) of execution times
    for named code sections. It uses an online algorithm to update statistics
    without storing the full history of measurements, making it memory-efficient
    for long-running training sessions.

    The implementation uses the incremental mean/variance computation from
    Sutton-Barto's Reinforcement Learning book, allowing O(1) updates for both
    mean and variance statistics.

    Note:
        This class is not thread-safe and should only be used in single-threaded
        contexts or with appropriate synchronization.

        _means (defaultdict[str, float]): Running means for each named section
        _vars (defaultdict[str, float]): Running variances for each section
        _counts (defaultdict[str, int]): Number of measurements per section

        are performed in O(1) time and space, making it efficient for long-running
        training sessions.

        The algorithm updates mean and variance estimates incrementally using:
            mean_{n+1} = mean_n + (x - mean_n)/(n + 1)
            var_{n+1} = (n * var_n + n * (mean_n - mean_{n+1})^2 + (x - mean_{n+1})^2)/(n + 1)
